# LAB
 
A Voxel-Engine, *infinite* world in all three spacial dimensions. Currently
work in progress. After the main engine has been written, custom modding
support gets added, for custom blocks etc... (Thats how the content should be
added).

# The language choice: C

Why do I use C for this project? For me its clean compared to other commonly
used languages. It forces you to write simpler code, that does not hide parts
of the code, that are important.
