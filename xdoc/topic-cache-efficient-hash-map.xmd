@@topic Spatial Cache-efficient Hash Map

*Status:* Not implemented

Group chunks together into chunk clusters or super chunks.
An entry in the hash map corresponds to a super chunk, which is mapped from
the coordinates as a key. Similar to how multiple world coordinates are mapped
to a single chunk by dividing xyz by a factor of 16. Chunks can be associated
with a super chunk.

This technique can be combined with the allocated blocks as described in
cache efficient linked lists.
